## I liked: 
Nice project to play around: practicing rotation of objects and navigation in the scene view (mental rotation). The project is simple, but an amazing first VR experience.

## My challenge: 
Preparing for the project 
My phone lacks the gyroscop. 
Now I have a phone with a gyroscop. Google Cardboard V1, the magnatic button was not working so I fixed it with another type of button 
(my post on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-and-Dirty-Fixing-Google-Cardboard-V1-Button/)).
