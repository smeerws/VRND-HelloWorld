P1: Susanne Meerwald-Stadler
Google VR SDK for Unity: version 1.0; gvr-unity-sdk-1.0.3
platform: Android 7.0, Sony Xperia X Compact

Duration: plain working hours: 2h, overall 1d.

I liked: Nice project to play around: practicing rotation of objects and navigation in the scene view (mental rotation). The project is simple, but an amazing first VR experience.

My challenge: Preparing for the project 
My phone lacks the gyroscop. 
Now I have a phone with a gyroscop. Google Cardboard V1, the magnatic button was not working so I fixed it with another type of button 
(my post on https://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-and-Dirty-Fixing-Google-Cardboard-V1-Button/).
